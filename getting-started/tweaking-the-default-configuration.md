# Tweaking the Default Configuration

GraphWeaver allows you to start with the default configuration but supply your own tweaks without having to fully eject from the command line tool. Any configuration that we generate and use can be overridden without taking ownership of the full build process.

To do this, TODO

We have also prepared some examples of this approach in action:

* TODO

Alternatively, if you want full control, there's no reason you have to use the command line tool, go ahead and [roll your own](roll-your-own.md).
